      <description>What is the nature of our perceived separation and differences with &amp;ldquo;art&amp;rdquo; and “the artist”? By writing fan letters, we explore and embody the experience of the distant admirer. Inspired by Franck Leibovici, we inquire into the &amp;ldquo;forms of life&amp;rdquo; behind and through the artwork and the artist. We engage with the scratches, spills, run-ons, shadows, and crumbs of art-making.
Mixing a genre of pop culture with the art of the obscure, oblique, peculiar, and offensive, to touch into what we may mistakenly conceive of as out of reach.</description>
