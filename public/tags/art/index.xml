      <description>Dear Tyler,
I am a big, big fan of your work!!!
I include three exclamation points (rather than just one), I use the word, “big” twice, and I use a 12-sized font (to contrast with the 11-sized font in the rest of the letter) in the above encomiastic opening, because a fanmail letter begs for such hyperbolic conventions. And of course, I sincerely, truly do admire your work!!! (note the superfluous use of two adjacent adverbs to infuse the sentence with intensity; if read aloud, the enunciation of “sincerely” and “truly” should be elongated and intonated more deeply).</description>

      <description>Dear Spyros,
I am so grateful to have this opportunity to properly tell you how much I admire your artistic practice. It’s perfect that our art piece/research project, that deconstructs lines between what we call “life” and “art,” has provoked this letter. In my opinion, you have mastered the dissolution of any such lines; and in such admirably artful, humble and inspiring ways.
As I’ve thought about these fan mail letters that we’re writing, I started by imagining personalities who are so different from me, that I’ve placed them in some imagined place “above” the reality in which I live.</description>

      <description>Dear L.M,
I’m taking this opportunity to (semi-formally) offer you words of gratitude and admiration for your work as an artist. It is a bit strange that I’m directing a fan letter to you, a close friend, but my curiosity of what I would say, and what you would say, overrode any reservations on my part. I do hope you read this letter with the sincerity with which it is intended.</description>
