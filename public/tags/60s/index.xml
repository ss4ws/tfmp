      <description>Dear Barbara,
I wish I was alive with you in the 60s. I crave the boldness and zest that you lived with; to immerse myself in it, to contortion my body and mind with it, to create with it. In many ways I see myself in you: the childlike curiosity; a laser-sharp focus on what you want, free of the burden of external opinions of a myopic mainstream; and a gloriously transcendent vision of life, yet an effortless capacity to connect with other beautiful humans.</description>
