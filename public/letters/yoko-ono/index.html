<p>Dear Ms. Ono,</p>
<p>I’ve been meaning to write to you for some time now, but have been dissuaded by (perhaps misplaced) assumptions that someone of your stature would not respond to a letter from someone of my “non-stature”; in conventional terms, I have no significant fan base to report, and my art work has not had significant public exposure. I am of course deeply inspired by your work in both the field of “art” as well as in the field of romantic relationships. Perhaps I am hoping for some pithy or elaborate insight from you, substantiating my own challenging experiences as a female artist of color making non-catchy art.</p>
<p>It was not until recently that I overrode the pragmatism and doubts that kept me from writing you, when a colleague and friend proposed that we write to artists whom we respect and admire. The suggestion has since then turned into both a research inquiry into the nature of fan mail, as well as an art piece itself; provocative in the questions we pose, indulgent in our methodology and medium, and open-ended and dynamic in our exploration.</p>
<p>So what originated as my own imagined connection with an artist I greatly admire, has evolved into a request for your participation in our art piece. I now leave the space open to your response, with an eager curiosity to see how the life of this piece will evolve, and a hopefulness that someone of your stature and experience will connect with me and, thereby, defy overly pragmatic sensibilities.</p>
<p>With deep respect and gratitude,</p>
<p>Aidyn Mills</p>
