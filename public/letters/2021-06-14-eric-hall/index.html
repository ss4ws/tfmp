<p>Dear Eric,</p>
<p>A few weeks back, on a Saturday morning in late May, I spent about an hour in the kitchen, before I found your profile on Spotify. During that time, I browsed a significant number of profiles on the streaming service, listening to a piece or two, then skipping to a new profile, to a new piece. I didn&rsquo;t know exactly what I was looking for. A way to describe it, would be to say that I was looking for the best fitting music for the day. It&rsquo;s never easy to put it in words because regular categories often related to emotions &ldquo;uplifting,&rdquo; &ldquo;retrospective,&rdquo; etc., don&rsquo;t work for me. More often than not, I am looking for textures.</p>
<p>My usual strategy, when I find myself in a similar situation, is to browse the &ldquo;Fans also like&rdquo; section on Spotify. In short, my search went from several <em>Raster-Noton</em> techno buffs to <em>Alarm Will Sound</em> and eventually to your profile. I spent the whole day doing home chores and listening to your music. At some point in the afternoon, I looked you up online and found your website along with your Vimeo account, where I watched several of your live performances. It was one of the best days of my summer so far. I basked in your music.</p>
<p>I am looking at the notes I scribbled on a yellow legal pad that day. The last thing at the bottom of the page is a quote that says &ldquo;Amplify the sonic minutiae.&rdquo; (I didn&rsquo;t do a good job keeping the source of the quote.) That&rsquo;s a perfect description of your music as you seem to work exclusively with found sounds, or the sounds generated by everyday objects&mdash;<a href="https://vimeo.com/443585443">even carrots</a>. I also like to think of each one of your improvisations as sonic rabbit holes. The deeper I go, the more I get glimpses of ample soundscapes, full of layered sound textures that reverberate into my brain tickling uncharted territories.</p>
<p>I really love your flavor of concrete music, and I wish to have a chance to listen to it one day live.</p>
<p>Spyros</p>
