      <description>Dear Tyler,
I am a big, big fan of your work!!!
I include three exclamation points (rather than just one), I use the word, “big” twice, and I use a 12-sized font (to contrast with the 11-sized font in the rest of the letter) in the above encomiastic opening, because a fanmail letter begs for such hyperbolic conventions. And of course, I sincerely, truly do admire your work!!! (note the superfluous use of two adjacent adverbs to infuse the sentence with intensity; if read aloud, the enunciation of “sincerely” and “truly” should be elongated and intonated more deeply).</description>

      <description>Dear Erica,

In a new tab, I type your name.</description>

      <description>Dear Gordon,
I just came across your piece, The Number of Inches Between Them. What a treasure.
What first caught my attention was the similarity between your work and ours of writing letters of appreciation to artists. But after a few minutes of listening to you read your letter of gratitude to your respective artist, I realized there was more to your work. I came to a simple, yet profound realization about something I’ve been contemplating: whether to know someone or something requires</description>
