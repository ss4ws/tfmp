Dear Alejandra,

I write to say thank you for your naked appraisal of life. I sometimes loathe all the lace and lipstick with which we cover what we see and do; which I myself have done, and on occasion still do. 

You reckoned with the limitations of words, using words themselves. You faced fears with mirrors. You wrote in the darkness to find light. So it is in your words, I see myself. I see myself in your search for a face without fear; a girl elusively self-portraited; a palimpsestic ambition for what should be, yet a compassionate nod towards what was; self-imposed censures; and a migrant soul beholden to the irrelevance of words. 

I am grateful for your honesty, and am saddened by your death. Yet, your shadows, of which you invited into your poetry, have become our shadows as well. We can see more clearly what we otherwise would perhaps not know, for without the words and without names, our shadows become more difficult to befriend. This act of naming is both treacherous and liberating. 

Below I respond to your poem, “Continuity.” Our words commiserate and collaborate. In my response, I find freedom. 


“Continuity” Alejandra Pizarnik, 1963
Not naming things by their names. Things have barbed edges, lush vegetation. But who is speaking in this room full of eyes? Who gnaws with a mouth made of paper? Names that come up, shadows with masks. Cure me of this void, I said. (The light loved itself in this darkness of mine. I knew that there was absence when I found myself saying, It is I.) Cure me, I said.


	“Emptiness” Aidyn Mills, 2020
I too was once pricked by the rigidity of things, these barbed edges and insistent spokes. Then I noticed the light catching on the contours of these metal rims, revealing speckles of my reflection. I began to turn these and other things at just the right angles, and soon they all became the same things. And I, too, knew there was emptiness when I saw myself.


With deep respect,

Aidyn
