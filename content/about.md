What is the nature of our perceived separation and differences with "art" and “the artist”? By writing fan letters, we explore and embody the experience of the "distant" admirer. Inspired by Franck Leibovici, we inquire into the "forms of life" behind and through the artwork and the artist. We engage with the scratches, spills, run-ons, shadows, and crumbs of art-making.

Mixing a genre of pop culture with the art of the obscure, oblique, peculiar, and offensive, to touch into what we may mistake as out of reach.
