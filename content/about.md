What is the nature of our perceived separation and differences with "art" / “the artist”? Are there boundaries to an artistic practice? By writing fan letters, we hope to unpack, explore and embody the experience of the "distant" admirer. Does "art" need to be demystified? Inspired by Franck Leibovici, we inquire into the "forms of life" behind the artwork and the artist.

Additionally, we experiment with the genre of fan mail. As it is predominately understood and practiced, fan mail is directed towards well-known individuals in pop culture. Here, we write to artists whose work is considered avant-garde; those whose ideas are obscure, not immediately gratifying, peculiar, inexplicable, and/or offensive. What is the meaning and experience of a conventional letter offering admiration, written by artists whose own work eschews conformity and definition? How would an uncommon artist respond to a common letter? Will they respond? Will they take it seriously? Will their trash cans appreciate it more?
